These guidelines will probably change.

## As a "Developer"

If you're already a "Developer" for the repo on GitLab:

1. Find an issue you'd like to work on that's not already assigned to someone.
1. Assign yourself.
1. Click the button [Create merge request][] to start working on it.
    See [New merge request][] for what this button does.
1. Do your work and push it to the branch that was created.
1. Ask for a review at any time.
    Feel free to ask for a review even if you're not ready to merge.
1. Wait for CI to pass.
1. Merge!
