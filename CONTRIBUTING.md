These guidelines will probably change.

## As a "Developer"

If you're already a "Developer" for the repo on GitLab:

1. Find an issue you'd like to work on that's not already assigned to someone.
1. Assign yourself.
1. Click the button [Create merge request][] to start working on it.
    See [New merge request][] for what this button does.
1. Do your work and push it to the branch that was created.
1. Ask for a review at any time.
    Feel free to ask for a review even if you're not ready to merge.
1. Wait for CI to pass.
1. Merge!

## Everyone else

1. Do a quick search to see if your concern has been reported yet.
    Chances are, there's an issue with different jargon used to describe the problem.
    It's okay if you don't find anything, you can still create a new issue.
1. If there's already an issue with your concern, please feel free to comment on that issue.
1. If there's not already an issue with your concern, please feel free to create a new issue.
    Don't worry if you think you might be making a duplicate issue.
    It's better that you report the concern than not.

We'll try our best to respond in a timely manner and keep the issues up to date.
Unfortunately, we're not able to accept merge requests from non-"Developers" right now.
Hopefully, that will change with time and we can start accepting contributions from outside again.
