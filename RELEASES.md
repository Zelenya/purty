## What is our release process?

We are currently doing time-based releases.
This is a release process inspired by many other projects:
[GitLab release process][], [GNOME's Time-Based Release Schedule][], [Ubuntu's TimeBasedReleases][].

Choosing time-based releases gives us a few benefits:
* We can keep a regular pace of development
* Motivation for finishing something at a given time increases
* People working on the software can have some expectations of what they're working on
* People using the software can have confidence about when releases come out

The most important part is to release when we say we will,
even if that means cutting items from the release.
In this process, it's better to be consistent with release dates than it is to hold out for a specific feature.

## When do we release?

We release a new version every Tuesday at 9AM Pacific.
The date and time were chosen arbitrarily and will probably change in the future as development slows down.

## How do we release a new version?
